# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio developed as part of the MSc in Data Science - Data Analytics and Algorithms module. The portfolio demonstrates practical implementations and deep understanding of various machine learning algorithms through enhanced Jupyter notebooks.

## Key Components

### 1. Algorithm Implementations
Each notebook in this portfolio includes:
- Implementation of core machine learning algorithms
- Significant modifications and enhancements to base implementations
- Detailed analysis of parameter tuning and its effects
- Performance metrics and comparisons
- Comprehensive documentation of changes

### 2. Focus Areas
The portfolio emphasizes three main aspects:
1. **Data Set Innovation**: Implementation of algorithms on new/modified datasets
2. **Algorithm Enhancement**: Exploration of algorithm variants and hyperparameter tuning
3. **Practical Deployment**: Creation of minimal deployments for serialized models

### 3. Documentation
Each implementation includes:
- Detailed logs of modifications
- Analysis of changes and their impacts
- Structured documentation following the CRISP-DM methodology
