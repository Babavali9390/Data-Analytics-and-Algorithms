# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation

Support Vector Machine is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. This implementation focuses on SVM classification with various kernel options.

## Features
- Multiple kernel functions:
  - Linear
  - Polynomial
  - Radial Basis Function (RBF)
  - Sigmoid
- Soft margin classification
- Support for multi-class classification
- Kernel trick implementation

## Use Cases
- Text Classification
- Image Classification
- Bioinformatics
- Face Detection
- Financial Analysis

## How It Works
1. Transform data using kernel function
2. Find optimal hyperplane that maximizes margin
3. Use support vectors to define decision boundary
4. Classify new points based on their position relative to hyperplane

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn (for comparison)

## Usage Example
```python
from svm import SVM

# Initialize the classifier
svm = SVM(kernel='rbf', C=1.0)

# Train the model
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = svm.predict(X_test)
```

## Performance Considerations
- Training Time Complexity: O(n²) to O(n³)
  - n: number of training samples
- Prediction Time Complexity: O(n_sv * d)
  - n_sv: number of support vectors
  - d: number of features

## Advantages
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Memory efficient
- Versatile through different kernel functions
- Robust against overfitting

## Limitations
- Sensitive to feature scaling
- Computationally intensive for large datasets
- Kernel selection can be challenging
- Not directly probabilistic

## Optimization Tips
1. Feature scaling is crucial
2. Kernel selection based on data characteristics
3. Parameter tuning (C, gamma, etc.)
4. Use cross-validation for parameter selection
