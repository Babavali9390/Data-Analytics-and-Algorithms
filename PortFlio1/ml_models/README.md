# Machine Learning Models Collection

This repository contains implementations of various popular machine learning algorithms. Each model is organized in its own directory with its specific implementation and related files.

## Models Included

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- Location: `/kmeans`
- An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups
- Commonly used for customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Location: `/knn`
- A supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression
- Simple yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points

### 3. Naive Bayes
- Location: `/naive_bayes`
- A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- Particularly effective for text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis

### 4. Random Forest
- Location: `/random_forest`
- An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees
- Excellent for both classification and regression tasks, with good protection against overfitting

### 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Location: `/svm`
- A powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression
- Particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples

## Getting Started
