# Random Forest Implementation

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Features
- Support for both classification and regression
- Feature importance calculation
- Out-of-bag error estimation
- Bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
- Random feature selection

## Use Cases
- Classification Tasks
- Regression Problems
- Feature Selection
- Outlier Detection
- Variable Importance Analysis

## How It Works
1. Create multiple decision trees using bootstrap samples
2. For each split, consider random subset of features
3. Grow trees to maximum depth or until stopping criteria
4. Aggregate predictions from all trees
   - Classification: Majority voting
   - Regression: Average prediction

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for comparison)

## Usage Example
```python
from random_forest import RandomForest

# Initialize the model
rf = RandomForest(n_trees=100, max_depth=None)

# Train the model
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf.predict(X_test)

# Get feature importance
importance = rf.feature_importance()
```

## Performance Considerations
- Training Time Complexity: O(n*log(n)*m*t)
  - n: number of samples
  - m: number of features
  - t: number of trees
- Prediction Time Complexity: O(log(n)*t)

## Advantages
- Reduces overfitting
- Handles missing values well
- Provides feature importance
- Parallel processing capable
- Works well with both categorical and numerical data

## Limitations
- Black box model
- Computationally intensive
- Memory intensive
- May overfit on noisy datasets

## Tuning Parameters
1. Number of trees
2. Maximum depth
3. Minimum samples per leaf
4. Number of features to consider at each split
5. Bootstrap sample size
